The most notable event I experienced was when a young person had presented with significant ongoing suicidal ideation who was dealing with a lot of shit. I spent a lot of time with them mostly deescalation and working out what the plan should be moving forward. \n\nOne of their parents came in a little while later and I had the opportunity to speak to them about where their child was and what had been going on, with their consent of course. Midway through me trying to explain some of the psychological constructs and ways the parent could help they said to me, \"is this going to take much longer I have a show to go and watch\".\n\nAll I can say is, I never judge my patients, I have never walked their path or viewed the world through their eyes. But the people around them who perpetuate the suffering of the people I work with through ignorance, malice and selfishness, I judge them.\n\nEdit and a shameless one. I've tried to reply to as much as I could, I've enjoyed some of what I would assume is trolling and talking about some other people's experiences as it's given me a chance to reflect on some of my own stuff. But I must go to bed. \n\nI'd like to ask one thing of anyone who reads this, remember that you can help, even just by asking how someone is or wishing them well. People who you think may be struggling and even people who aren't. This year has been hard on us all, and I appreciate all of you who have said that those in care services have difficult jobs, but we have all struggled this year. Please be as kind as you can to each other and I hope we can all look forward to a good December and even better new year.\n\nEdit 2. My use of the word 'judge' needs some clarification, I do judge in some ways, it's hard not to with what I see, who I work with and the situations they experience or have experienced. What I mean by not judging is that I do not allow my judgements to distort what I am seeing or how I am working. Which will normally be to the benefit of the patient and those around them trying to help them achieve their goals and meet their needs.\n\nFinal edit. I didn't think this post would get as big as it has. And I cannot respond to every comment individually by any means. I'm sure the post will be getting less attention moving forward but I just wanted to clarify some things.\n\nThis parent, who many people have made multiple assumptions about, was not trying to redirect, deflect or remove themselves from the situation by stating they had a show to watch. The show being something else people have assumed was a TV show. Remember I've made the comment above in the context of a situation that lasted around 5 to 6 hours for me, but took you a few minutes to read.\n\nWith everything that's going on right now I wanted to make this post to let people know, those working in mental health have heard a lot, we don't judge you for how or what you're feeling and we want to work with you to help you. I simply wanted to help in some way with a comment on the Internet that I wrote in one go about an experience I have had. I know that the response to this has been overwhelmingly positive but I would also like to say I did not mean to cause any offence or upset to anyone or claim that I am some sort of unachievable goal of non-judgement. \n\nAnyway, I'm going to try and forget about this now.

I spent a whole day (or most of it, anyway) in blessed air conditioning, ate all the food, drank all the water, and was more or less ready to go again.\n\nI took a few more one-day breaks between Missouri and Williamsburg, VA which really helped me out.\n\nSo yeah, one step back, two steps forward.

{"prompt": "Women of reddit, what do you think about the fall of constantinople in 1453 by the ottoman forces led by Mehmed II?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Welp I'm a Greek woman and I'm doing my masters in history, and have done a paper on the music about the fall of Constantinople. In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.\n\nEdit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O\nEdit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event.

{"prompt": "Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I used to work at a Boy Scout Summer Camp. Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a \"secluded\" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.\n\nAnyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.\n\nAll of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard.

{"prompt": "People who are 40+ and happy with their life, what is your advice to people in their 20s?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I am 40 years old and I have three pieces of advice for anyone in their 20's\n\n1. Accept that perfection doesn't exist. Your relationships will have problems, your car will break down, someone else will anyways have a better phone, a newer car, or a bigger house than you, no matter where on the social ladder you stand. Constantly chasing perfection will keep you permanently stressed. That doesn't mean you should not try to better your life, just know that if you expect perfection you will never be statisfied. \n\n2. Pay attention to your diet and health. I have been working out at least 4 times per week since my mid 20's. I am fitter, healthier and look younger than almost everyone else my age\n\n3. Don't stop doing the things you love. Even though I have a wife, kids, job etc. I still make time to play video games, draw, write stories, read comics, play basketball, listen to music, etc. There is no reason to become a miserable old bastard!\n\nEDIT: Wow! This has blown up way more than I expected. Thanks for the awards a guys. Its nice to know my advice can be useful to others.\n\nEDIT 2: So, quite a few people have asked how I find time to fit in all these hobbies. As I said, I have to make the time. Apart from working out (which I do at 6am before everyone else wakes up) I'm not doing these things every day. I only game on the weekend if I get the chance, I read ebooks on my phone when I'm killing time in the day, I may buy a comic 2-3 times a year and I can usually find a few hours in the week to draw. I still make time to chill out with my wife in the evenings and do things with kids. I just fit my hobbies in between them. I also don't watch much TV or go out, but that's just me.

You'll be hearing from my lawyer!\"  You're laughing... \"haha, no way anyone would be so petty....\" Nope. \n\nEnforcing accountability in child support provided expenses just opens up the worst legal can of worms imaginable. \n\nedit: as for why I'd like to see it: I don't have any visibility into how my money gets spent and it irks me. Further more, my ex frequently rings up and asks for the next support payment early. Yes, often times there are valid reasons. So and so needed shoes. Fees for school trips. etc. But I also know she spends way above her means on a lot of fun, entertainment based discretionary things, then she realizes \"whups, can't buy groceries! tee hee! pleeeeeze?\". So she gets to be the \"fun\" parent. Welp kids, looks like we're going for long walks in the park again this weekend. Hooray for the library.\n\nedit2: ok, 600 replies. Child support is contentious on Reddit. So far, the themes are:\n\n- yes, its 2017, we should have the technology to implement this. Maybe some magic debit card or EBT style.\n- no, current child support departments are bunged up enough, this would kill them.\n- stop giving in to your ex - if she asks for money early in the future just ask what she needs specifically and buy it for her, then take that off the subsequent payment - GOOD idea!.\n- people are petty.\n- so put a law like this in motion. But to prevent abuse, the cost for an audit is borne by the parent who asked for it... or variations on that (I _like_ that idea.)\n- ARTICHOKE SCULPTURE\n- ok we got a sprog in here.

There are still people who come out and block the roads on monthly anniversaries of 721, 831 and the death of the college student protester (I think thats 1113).\n\nThe prosecution from the government hasn't stop. Just yesterday a councilwoman was arrested with some charge that was not used since 1967. RTHK which produces documentaries and satire show are under attack from the pro-Beijing camps. The Police beat suspects until they are too injured to attend their court hearings.\n\nBut on a some fronts the fight is still continuing. Volunteers still put up poster art on walls even though the risks of just doing that has been greater and greater. There are people planning the strategy to Legco (legislative council) election that will take place near the end of 2020. You see pictures of masked protesters holding the \"Free HK, Revolution Now\" flag around Hong Kong to remind people not to forget about the cause and the people who made sacrifices for it. Groups are still trying to get other countries to pass legislations to support our fight for freedom and autonomy. Some individuals are trying to sue the police in a civil suit.\n\nAlso some pro-Beijing legco members are pushing to pass \"Article 23\", a national security law which will effectively end freedom of speech and assembly. There has been a lot of talk about for to push this back so I guess we will see.\n\nI feel like everyone are realizing even though the pitch battles with fire and bricks are what draw the headlines, but we are in for a long fight. Preserving our culture, our language and our values in the long run is as important as anything else. I know the odds are stacked against us and all anyone can talk about is how powerful the CCP is, but we are not giving up yet\n\nFree Hong Kong, 5 demands Not One Less\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold and awards kind strangers!

She sends them presents and cards, she knows what they like, we've even started having Facebook calls with her. She's so warm and giving and gives them 100% of her attention, which is something parents just can't do as often as kids would like. They'll go running around the room holding the phone up to different things saying stuff like \"Ruth it snowed! Look!\" My wife got nervous yesterday because they took the phone outside to play in the snow and were having so much fun throwing snowballs at the phone -- I told her screw it, if they break the phone doing something like that I'll buy a new one. It's worth it.\n\nShe's like part of our family, and it's all because technology initially allowed her to \"passively\" participate with us. The relationship grew organically over time the way relationships used to before the internet -- you'd see people frequently at work or at the store or in your neighborhood, over time have longer conversations, and ultimately grow to be friends. The same thing happened here: it started with a like or a comment here or there, then a couple messages, then a virtual birthday card... it enables people to remain in communication with so many more people passively when used correctly.\n\nOur kids have never even met her physically, though. Her immune system is too delicate to accept visitors. But even through a 6\" screen, it's like she's really here.

We were signing the contract for the event and I kept thinking that it was quite remote, so I asked: \"how much time does it take for the ambulance to get here?\" \n\nI became the laughing stock of both families. My (then future) mother in law, who was present at the meeting, literally fell down from the chair laughing. The wedding organizer, remembered it for weeks, telling about it everyone we met. My dad, ended every sentence with \"...but maybe you need an ambulance for that\". My wife was making siren noises, when I was saying something we disagreed on. Every family dinner all the aunts and uncles were \"checking\" if the ambulance was present. You name it. The entire package.\n\nStill I couldn't get rid of this weird feeling. It would have taken over an hour for the ambulance to get to the garden. After a few weeks I ended up paying a private ambulance to be present at the wedding.\n\nFast forward to the ceremony. As my wife literally walks down the aisle, at the back of the garden I see two Paramedics running with a stretcher and my dad squeezing my hand whispering: \"that's not of your god damn business, let them to take care of it. \"\n\nWhat happened was that one of our older guests got a heart attack and almost died at ceremony. Was saved by the private ambulance.\n\nEver since then, when my wife tells me that I'm overthinking, I just do the siren noise.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT\n\nWell... thanks for the awards everybody, glad you liked the story.

In fact they told him he had to stop donating because there was a statistical probability his progeny could meet and date (at least they seemed ethical).

There was one guy, in the east Midlands, UK, who was one of the adult instructors. He was always telling us about amateur radio, and would hand out old/cheaper pieces of tech he'd tried out and wasn't keeping.\n\nAnyway, he was a little weird, overly friendly (with adults, never had any bad vibes around the kids) and obviously had some social anxiety which he was compensating for, personally I suspect he was on the autistic spectrum, but who knows. After I left the cadets and went to Uni, I stayed in touch on Facebook. We were in the same Facebook group for amateur radio hobbyists.\n\nHe always liked to do things by the book, and instilled in us the importance of being responsible and socially conscious with our radio use. He was the same on Facebook, reminding people that Mrs Miggins on her 10 handset wouldn't know about transmission power, and squelch, etc. He mentioned in passing to a new member the importance of only using the public unlicensed channels (kind of like CB Radio in the US) on the correct, very low, power setting of half a watt. He mentioned it was because Mrs Miggins trying to reach her kid in the next street wouldn't understand the idea that she could hear you but couldn't reach you to ask you to be quiet a minute. He was correct here, and it's also a criminal offence to transmit at higher power on these frequencies, even though its not enforced. \n\nAnyway, this got someone's back up, and he was kicked from the group for \"preaching\".\n\nAfter unsuccessfully asking to be let back in, he set up a larger antenna in his back garden, set up a super fancy aerial atop it, with a 30 Watt transmission system... (this is really quite powerful) \n\nHe now turns this on for several hours a day on whatever channels the radio club/group are using to 'teach them the importance of good etiquette'. This means that nobody can use certain frequencies for hours at a time, as it just sounds like someone is having a one way conversation on air.\n\nHe could probably get arrested, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all.

{"prompt": "Teachers of reddit, what are some signs that a student is being abused or lives in a toxic environment ?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Regression.\n\nIm a speech therapist who works in an inner city elementary children where we see a lot of poverty, drug abuse, etc. I had one case stand out to me in particular that stands out. \n\nI saw a little girl, 7 years old, who had been delayed on her language skills. We knew she had a very difficult upbringing since she was the product of a rape. She lived only with her mother who impressively kept the two events (the rape and the birth of her daughter) as separated as possible. The rapist (who I refuse to call a father) had served time in jail but was released at this point on house arrest. He had no rights to see her. But the rapists parents, technically the childs grandparents, went to court and  demanded rights to see their granddaughter. They refused to ever believe their son was a rapist. Some judge, who I hope thinks of this case often, allowed it as long as father was not present. It started as supervised visits and eventually turned into visitation without supervision. Mom fought as hard as she could, but she couldnt afford a lawyer like the grandparents could. Mom had to drop her daughter off to the parents of her rapist every other weekend for one night. I dont know how she did it.\n\nAnyways, I started to see a huge regression in her language skills. Her mean length of utterance decreased, she couldnt logically organize her thoughts into sentences, she couldnt categorize anymore and so forth. Academically when I spoke to the teacher she said the same thing. But it really came to a head when she started to regress in other, non-school related skills. \nOne day she wet her pants in my classroom. And she just lost it. She was crying, she destroyed my room, she was hitting and punching to the point where I had to restrain her from hurting herself. She just lost it. Finally when she calmed down, I brought her down to the nurse, got her a change of pants. But this was a girl was not only potty trained since Id known her, but she was known for being sweet, polite and just slow to warm up. She was NOT a child to have outbursts like this. She wasnt sick. And I felt like I really needed to say something outside the school.\n\nLong story short, grandparents were sneaking over to fathers house so that her father could see and help raise his daughter. Turns out he started inappropriately touching her in the bathroom, during tub time, at the kitchen table, watching TV. Basically any chance he could when the grandparents walked out the room for any amount of time.\n\nMy heart broke for the mom. Ill never forget her telling us about how she couldnt live with herself knowing the fact that the man who raped her, also touched her daughter. Anyways, you can probably imagine all the hurt and heartbreak the mother felt. END OF THE COMMENT"}

Apparently, neither of them thought to flip the lid upside down (you know that gross trick some kids do with their upper eyelids?). It was a painful maneuver for her very swollen eyelid, which might explain it. Anyhow, there appeared to be what looked like a visible abscess inside the tissue with thick gooey material, I thought Id give it a nudge and saw it move. This wasnt an abscess, it was something else. I managed to remove it quite easily in one whole piece. It was a fly larva. The patient told me that she had a bug hit her in the eye a few days before she got this infection. I removed the larva and within two days the wound closed and she was 100% recovered on basic antibiotic eye drops. Yes, I do have the photos from this case for those interested.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: Patient had a bug lay an egg in her eyelid and I removed the larva. END OF THE COMMENT"}

I try to reassure and tell the person that we wont leave their side, that we will take care of them and that they will be fine. It kind of fucks me up a bit to say this to someone but I always include the last part because I just dont see the point in telling them the truth.

{"prompt": "People who take out their phones to record strangers who are having bad days: Why?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One time I actually went verbally abusive towards my neighbour for this. \n\nMy fianc is an epileptic. His seizures can be live threatening as they sometimes stop his heart. One evening last year he had one of those and I had to perform CPR. I obviously simultaneously called an ambulance and they came shortly after, leaving the lights on because they had to park in the middle of the street.\n\nNow after a seizure, my fianc is very disoriented. He doesn't know where he is, who he is, who anyone else is, it sometimes differs, but it's always bad. On this particular day, he remembered me and took to me for help in his confusion. He couldn't fell his legs, he didn't know what was happening, he didn't realize he only hat his underpants on (we had gone to sleep about an hour before and it was a very hot day). He was bleeding from his mouth because he had bitten a tiny bit of his tongue off and his chest was red from me hitting it during CPR. He looked awful. \n\nWhen the paramedics and I helped him outside to bring him to the ambulance, he wasn't able to put any clothes on due to his disorientation and would shrug any blanket off because it was too hot.\n\nThe neighbour, alerted by the siren and lights of the ambulance, was standing outside his house, beer in hand, filming us. I helped put my fianc into the ambulance and went to grab a bag of stuff for the hospital. My fianc cried out for me like a lost child since I was the only person he recognised. It was heartbreaking. And my asshole of a neighbour filmed it all while laughing his drunken ass off. I went over, yelled at him in very explicit language and demanded he delete the video. He just laughed at me. \n\nWell, joke was on him. I called the cops and they took the phone. He got to pay a fine for filming a person without permission (illegal in Germany) and has now orders to stay away from us. \n\nI still wonder what he thought while doing this.

You never expressed any kind of disdain or machismo when I asked for your help untangling my Barbie's hair or prodding you with magic fairy wands. \n\n* You never hesitated to teach me practical skills - and you never attributed gender to them. It was always, \"Come over here and let me show you how to snake the drain, because you're going to need to do this.\" BTW dad, I snaked my first drain all on my own last month! I'm so glad you taught me.\n\n* Thank you for bailing me out when I was in a pinch, no questions asked. No guilting, no attempts at squeezing out information. I felt like I could come to you with any dilemma. This took a load of my shoulders because Mom is so reactive and \"freak out first, maybe resolve later.\" \n\n* You respect me, which makes me respect you even more. When I call you out on BS, you actually repent and reflect. You don't deflect back on me and pull the, \"I'm the parent and know better than you\" spiel. \n\n* You actually took the time to sit and watch my cartoons or (attempt) to understand my video games or other hobbies. Mom always turned up her nose. You didn't. Do you know how awesome it is to watch your Dad actually laugh at the cartoon your mother just dismissed as \"dumb\" minutes before? So gratifying.\n\n* All those times you went shopping for groceries and picked up ladies sanitary supplies without any hesitation, even if you did affectionately rename the long super maxi pads, \"low-salt maxis.\"\n\n* Thank you for all those secret times you let me pick something out of the vending machine to eat when we were on trips together - you knew Mom would never allow it.\n\n* You take great pride in \"embarrassing me\" - but you know exactly where to draw the line so it's endearingly goofy, not genuinely embarrassing. You know your audience and play to it. I feel no shame when my friends (or now-fiance) are around you.\n\n* It's okay if your hands were too callused to properly tie my ballet skirt before classes. I could tie it myself. But I didn't tell you at the time because I knew it made you happy to help me. So don't be embarrassed because the fabric kept snagging on your calluses.\n\n* I wish you took your dental hygiene more seriously. I think your lax attitude and seeing you lose a lot of your teeth didn't set the best example for my sister while we were growing up.\n\n**EDIT - did not expect Gold, yikes!** I realize closing with a comment about my Dad's flossing habits is kind of lame but it was stream of consciousness. I'm getting married in the fall and have been planning on writing a letter to my parents separately, so many of the points I made here I already want to share with him. He's my hero!\n\n**EDIT EDIT** Just in case people are worried, I adore my mom and we're really close. This probably makes her sound like a buzzkill, but I swear I could absolutely spend all day writing how incredible she is too. \n\nAlso, I called my dad and the first thing he says when he picks up is, \"Oh good!

We nearly called the cops before we realized it wasnt human.\n\n- Used needles. The worst being a tie between porcupine couch and the lady who literally handed me a *paper bag* full of syringes she found during a park cleanup.\n\n- large container of old crystallized picric acid. Bomb squad had to deal with that one.\n\nThe best:\n\n- a high end laptop in perfect condition except for a tiny crack on the lcd panel. Easy DIY repair that took $40 and 5 minutes, thing wouldve cost $1.5K new\n\n- enough brand new furniture to literally furnish my whole apartment \n\n- a high end military grade inflatable boat, brand new \n\nThe weirdest:\n\n- a 1st gen platelet counting machine, complete with weird tubes of bright green liquid and mercury. When I was prepping it for hazmat disposal I had to call the company that bought the company that made it for some info... they never digitized the records but the oldest repair tech still working was super excited because he remembered servicing them 50 years ago.\n\n- coffin. No body, just the coffin. Couldnt see anything wrong with it either.\n\n- buckets of testicles (from a ranch) that had been sitting out in the summer heat for a week. Smelled so bad my coworker hurled. Thats not the weird part... the weird part is the guys *wanted their buckets back.* Do you know how bad it has to smell to make a garbage collector puke? And they wanted them back?!\n\n- the $10k duffel bag. Lady came in super upset because earlier she threw out a duffel bag that she didnt know her boyfriend kept cash in. Over $10,000 in cash. We never found the bag.\n\n- 16 full size barrels of old vegetable grease some guy had saved up in his garage. He was planning to make a biodiesel car or something.\n\nEdit: a lot of people are asking if we get to keep stuff. Officially, no. Its not against the law as far as I know (except for illegal stuff like drugs), but its against our policy. However workers do salvage things... as long as its discreet and theyre not selling it, management doesnt get involved. Selling stuff is a big no.\n\nWe dont fight over stuff. In fact well keep an eye out for things colleagues might need. Most of what we salvage is actually tools and stuff we use at the dump. Ive also started a management approved program to give away free household products that would otherwise be hazardous waste (paint, oil, cleaners, etc). Some dumps also run thrift stores to divert materials from landfill, but we dont have the space. END OF THE COMMENT"}

{"prompt": "How do you feel about a law stating that tickets (speeding, driving under influence etc.) should be a percentage of the perpetrators annual wage, instead of fixed rates?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Its worth noting that in the US, this has been tried/proposed several times in several jurisdictions and courts toss it out.  This is a *massive* simplification (bc the full explanation is super complicated), but in the US punishments must be clearly delineated (eg not arbitrary) in the statute and based on the crime itself, not on the perpetrator her/himself.  And to be clear - a judge has discretion to waive/reduce/etc due to hardship, but it really doesn't work the other way (eg, a judge can give you the 'max' but s/he can't just arbitrarily tack on a punishment higher that the statute permits b/c you are rich.)\n\nEDIT to add: getting way too many replies to answer ppl, but here is something to think about: The 8th amendment plus the 14th amendment together prohibit punishments that are 'arbitrary.'  This means that when you are punished for a crime, there has to be a set penalty in place. This means that if two people commit the *exact* same crime under the *exact* same circumstance in the *exact* same jurisdiction, they would get the *exact* same punishment.  If a punishment was based on your income, you'd get two different outcomes - this is why these laws get tossed.  There's a famous quote I'm butchering that goes something like 'justice can never be served by the roll of the dice,' meaning different outcome for different people in identical situations isn't justice.\n\nAnother thing to consider - your income itself is *also* arbitrary.  On monday you're unemployed; the next day you take your last dollar and win the lottery; if you got a ticket monday, the punishment is $0 on tuesday your punishment is $$$$$ - with no change in the law itself; that's too arbitrary in the eyes of the law.  There are also several other challenges in the way of income-based fines, but the 8th plus 14th amendments are the big ones.\n\nFinal edit: there's a ton of \"but in Germany...\" or \"but in finland...\"  or \"if it works in Europe, it can work here.\" Other countries can do whatever they want; in the US we are bound by the US Constitution - there's not a lot of wiggle room short of 1) passing an amendment, or 2) pushing through a whole new interpretation of several amendments and getting a whole shit load of precedent reversed.

{"prompt": "What's one of the dumbest things you've ever spent money on?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Chef Boyardee beefaroni. One summer, because I was hella bored, I bought some chef Boyardee beefaroni and put it in my friend's mailbox as a prank. He didn't find it but his parents did, and they asked their neighbors who did it. He suspected me at first, but I managed to get him off of my tail. Now our neighborhoods were fairly close to eachother, so I could be over there in a 50 minute walk. Every night, I walked up to their neighborhood (walking anywhere at 2:am is creepy as hell but the Boyardee bandit does not stop for demons) and put a can of beefaroni inside their mailbox. After about a month, they call the police to find out who's putting beefaroni in their mailbox. Luckily the police really didn't care that much and just told them to get a camera which they eventually did. Meanwhile my friend is telling me all of this from his perspective, right, so I usually know what they do before I strike. So I start covering my face, and pretend to hunch over. I have no idea where this camera is, so I can never be too careful. They call the cops again and give them a profile, and now the cops are looking for a crippled beefaroni bandit. After a solid 3 months of this shit, one of the baggers at the store gets word somehow, and starts getting suspicious because he sees me buying tons of beefaroni. He confronts me, I tell him the truth, and I shit you not he starts helping me beefaroni my friend's house. We're putting it all over hiding it in the lawns, porch, fence, you name it. Halloween rolls around, and I dress up as chef Boyardee. I go to my friends house and say \"your daily subscription to Chef Boyardee beefaroni has ended. Would you like to renew?\". I hear laughter in the background, and it's the store clerk. Turns out he recently started dating best friend's sister, and that's how he heard. Truth be told, I don't think I've ever been punched harder than when my friend found out. Good times. We still laugh about it from time to time.\n\nTLDR. Bought and hid chef Boyardee beefaroni for nearly half a year around my best friend's house. The Beefaroni bandit strikes again! END OF THE COMMENT"}
{"prompt": "Ex-homeless redditors, what was the scariest thing that you ever saw on the streets? [NSFW]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I was homeless back when I was 19. After a few weeks of sleeping rough I was approached one evening by a man dressed as a priest, at this point I had no idea if he was a priest or someone out to deceive me.\n\nBeing wary of the priest outfit I straight away told him I have no interest in talking about God. What he said next has stuck with me ever since \"I am not here to talk about God, I'm here to make sure you are safe\".\n\nWe talked for quite a while until it was dark and that's when he offered me a bed for the night, alarm bells were going off in my head but he had seemed genuine so I went with him.\n\nHe drove me to a house in the suburbs and asked me to wait in his car whilst he spoke to someone. A few minutes later he returned with another man who offered to let me sleep in his garage for the night. Everything inside me was saying 'this is a bad idea' but I accepted as I had nothing left to lose.\n\nThe garage was pretty standard, tools, workbench etc. except in the corner there was a box spring and some blankets. There was a connecting door to the main house that the man told me he would have to keep locked during the night, he apologised but said he had kids in the house and couldn't take the risk.\n\nThe priest asked if he could come by in the morning and speak to me, then went into the house the man.\n\nI don't think I slept at all that night, I was terrified. I had no reason to be afraid of either man as they had been nothing but nice to me, however after living on the streets for a while you come to learn that nothing comes for free and you shouldn't trust anyone.\n\nThe morning rolls around and the most amazing thing happened, the man knocked on his own garage door to ask me if he could come in. This might not sound amazing but when you've been living rough with zero privacy, someone asking if they can enter your space (which is actually his space) gives you a sense of being human again, someone actually respects you enough to ask your permission.\n\nI spoke with both him and the priest every day for the 7 weeks I slept in his garage. Between them they managed to get me into a subsidised efficiency apartment (think studio apartment but a lot smaller), got me a job and helped me get my life back on track.\n\nThat was over 20 years a go and I will also be indebted to both of them.\n\nI still send Christmas cards to the man who's garage was my home and visited him two years a go for Thanksgiving. Sadly, the priest passed a way a few years back but I guarantee that if there is a heaven, he got fast tracked in. END OF THE COMMENT"}

So much, that it was hard to close up and wrap the sandwich without some olives spilling out. \n\nSome of my coworkers would only give her so much before they refused to add more. There were no rules, to my knowledge, stating a limit on the amount of black olives a customer could request, so I always obliged. Knowing this, she would refuse help from my coworkers and wait for me to make her footlong black olive sandwich. She would always comment that it was something she started ordering after becoming pregnant and it was the baby that wanted the olives. \n\nSome time had passed where I didnt see her come in anymore.

{"prompt": "Teachers of reddit what is the most depressing thing a student has told you about their home life?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I kept having this kid come and sleep in the 1st period. I mean thats normal for high school. One day I made pancakes as a treat and the kid didnt sleep, they ended up staying up and ate 6 pancakes. \nLater the kid told me they often dont eat breakfast because their parents dont buy food. When they have extra money it goes to buying alcohol. After hearing that I went and bought Breakfast foods and left them out for anyone to take. The kid didnt sleep after that.\n\nEdit: I didnt think this would blow up. But I wanted to clarify, the parents didnt qualify for food stamps or any help because they made too much money. At least it looked like they did on paper but really they didnt. I lived in the Bay Area  at the time and even though they made a lot, most the money went to rent it living expenses. They also generally seemed to make bad choices, not judging them but it seemed kids came last often.\nI think one thing that came from the pandemic that is good is the free food that many schools are handing out. Its wonderful to see. In the past our district would still offer meals in the summer to any kid under 18 who showed up to summer school even if not attending.\n\nContinued: someone mentioned these parents should be judged. I agree they sound horrible. But one thing I keep in mind when working with kids is trauma is multi generational. We dont know what impacted these  parents to behave this way. \nPersonally, my mother grew up very poor and in abusive home. Her parents had gone through the Holocaust and it really impacted them. They didnt know how to be parents and struggled with mental health issues in a time that didnt  really provide support/ had negative stigma of mental health. So this trauma was passed on to my mom. My mom was a good mom but wasnt always there for us emotionally because of her own attachment style she developed from her parents. So the trauma was passed on to us. \nNow that I am a parent I have to work super hard not to pass on the negative things I learned from my parents but changing behavior can be hard. \nI am not making an excuse for this kids parents. Something I learned while studying psychology ( my BA is psychology) is trauma passes through generations. \nI had a teacher once say something I always keep in mind when working with students: kids can impact and change parents behavior. Parents behavior and personality can change because of the child as well. Not saying this kid lead the parents to drink but rather having a kid who has special needs, doesnt bond with you the way you wanted  or doesnt behave how you expected them to can really impact you as a person.\n\nEdit 2: yes I reported these parents. I called cps on them several times. I reported this to school admin, I talked to the school psych about this, I gently talked to the parents about this as well. Judging a parent isnt helpful, but helping and educating a parent is what is needed. If the system fails we can only do so much. So if it takes spending $6 bucks on a bag of pancake mix every month I can do that. Sometimes we have to have short term goals to meet before we can fix the long term ones. So if just giving the kid food when hungry helps I will do it while we work on fixing the bigger issue. \nWhen I started to feed the kids breakfast I partly did it with this one kid in mind but I realized it wasnt just this kid who came to school hungry. Teens have sleeping issues and sometimes they dont get up early enough for breakfast. Some people cant sleep till 3 am, some kids have horrible anxiety and they are up all night and cant sleep, heck I bet a lot of those kids I worked with where simply not morning people and getting up to go to school sucked for them. I saw kids who came from good homes come to school hungry because something other than neglect caused it (though in this case it was neglect dont get me wrong). \nAll I am saying is we cant judge a parent, we sometimes have to find a fast solution while fixing the bigger picture.

I had a membership at Lifetime on and off through college.  I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didnt need the membership during the school year.  I tried to cancel at the end of one summer.  I was at the gym one day and I asked about cancellation.  I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel.  I complied.  When I showed up the person doing the cancellations wasnt there.  I was told to return the following Wednesday.  Surprise, surprise, the person wasnt there again.  I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company.  They responded by telling me that theyd take me to collections then.  I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership cancelled.  They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me.  After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness, and maintained that membership for about 10 years.  When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where Ive been for the last 5-6 years.  I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining a Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed.  Its really a loss for both of us.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards everybody!  I cant believe the attention this has received.  It seems that many of you have found yourselves in similar situations.  I encourage you to check out your local YMCA.  YMCAs are unique in that their membership cost structure is designed to subsidize memberships for individuals and families that otherwise could not afford one.  They also tend to be active in the community, hosting events like the Special Olympics.  Thanks for all the comments, Ill read through them this evening! END OF THE COMMENT"}

{"prompt": "Redditors who lived in countries that no longer exist (Like Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia...etc) What was it like to see your country breakup?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I was born in Yugoslavia, mid 80s.  It was sad. I lived in a major city largely untouched by direct attack, but we had all three major ethnicities heavily represented and it was incredibly confusing as to why friends stopped being friends, families broke up, etc.  As kids we understood what was happening, but not why.  \n\nI remember hiding my next door Muslim neighbor when the military police came.  I remember being embarrassed of who I was  (even though my family lineage has mixed roots).  I remember weeks without electricity, without running water.  Doing homework by candlelight.  Military rations.  One bottle of oil to last months. \nFlour was scarce. The river would carry sounds of gunfire and explosions.  I saw my dad only a few times in 5 years.  Afterwards I remember thinking that was lucky, some didn't see their dads at all.\n\nI remember my dad spending what little time he had at home teaching me how to use various guns, \"just in case\".  Afterwards, some people lost their minds.  One of the soldiers was convinced the enemy was still there, ever present.  He would place small explosives that looked like canned food in the cupboards where his wife and kids were, in his mind to protect them.  A couple drank themselves to death, I always believed they died in the forest outside the town years ago.  Businesses closed, factories were empty.  There was still work for some, but no pay.  The currency was worthless.  You'd get paid sometimes, in the morning, and by the afternoon it wasn't even enough for a roll of toilet paper. Weird, scary times.  Air raid sirens would interrupt soccer games.\n\nI remember wondering why I couldn't see some of my friends.  Explanations back then didn't make sense.  They still don't.  For the people that lived, worked and played together, we never wanted that shit.  It was pushed on us, manipulated us, played to our fears and insecurities.

After about a month of playing this new guy goes in and changed the password, steals the account and defriends everyone. Completely disappears off the map with all of our stuff. \n\nFast forward a year later and my family moves to Texas and its my first day at school. Im sitting in algebra class talking to the person in the seat next to me and he mentions he plays diablo. I said me too and that I ran a clan and everything.

{"prompt": "What was the weirdest thing the weird kid did at school?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A kid I grew up with started wearing home made chain mail to school our freshman year of high school. Every day. For all 4 years. \n\nHe was always pretty odd, but he was nice enough. Plus we had a few classes together thru middle school and we had connected over a shared love of a few videogames, so I felt comfortable asking him why he started wearing it all of the sudden. \n\nHe proceeded to explain the defensive benefits of chain mail vs. both sharp and blunt instruments of harm. For like 5 solid minutes. Daggers. Pikes. Hammers. Even how curved blades like katana and falchions would struggle against it! \n\nI basically just shrugged and told him \"I mean, makes sense.\" And we both went to our classes. \n\nI don't know what I expected, but I guess it wasn't the basic defensive benefits that armor offers.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you all! This is a much more widespread phenomenon than I had thought! This all took place in Wyoming (before it ceased being) for all the people wondering if it was their own knightly scholar.\n\nEdit 2: I believe he wore an undershirt, then armor and then an over shirt. The armor was about 55lbs (I think) and it had a full hood (widows peak and all) and sleeves. This was in the 2000's so school shootings were definitely a thing, but not quite a weekly event, yet (yay America!). Also, I'm not gonna say his name, like I said, he was always nice and I'm not about to dox an old homie. Plus Wyoming has like 35 people in it, so... yeah...\n\nI also was not trying to shame him at all, I think it was way cool and creative. Like the thread may suggest, a little weird, but I absolutely applaud the ingenuity to craft it all himself, so I don't want anyone who reads this to think I was shaming or bullying.\n\nIf you want to make chainmail for school or work or church or whatever, hell yeah, lil homie, be your own beautiful self!

It's a huge deal for him and a game changer career wise (I don't fully understand why or the details but he's been saving for a year, sold his car and stuff so it's a huge deal for him). He's supposed to have the money to pay everything before December 30th.\n\nWhen he goes to pay, he'll find out it's already paid. \n\nBest part is he gets to believe, for a week, all he's got from me is a pair of socks.\n\nEdit: Wow! I didn't expect this reaction. Thanks everyone for the awesome comments and for the awards. This community is truly amazing! \n\nI thought I'd provide more information here to try and answer some of the questions :)\n\nWe live in Brazil and he's going to the UK for a year and a half. \n\nHe'll be taking his masters there for a year and a half. This has been a goal of his for a while and, according to him, will help him get a good job in a larger company in one of the capitals. We live in a small town, not a lot of options for someone in his line of work.\n\nAs to why he's been saving for a whole year, we're in Brazil. Exchange rate is 1 GBP to 5.47 BRL. That alone is quite the challenge. \n\nHe's been saving for tuition + accommodation for the first two months and is paying through a local travel agency. The owner is a close personal friend, so I'm not very worried about him paying twice.\n\nTo everyone worried about the car, he was going to sell it anyways. It doesn't make any sense to keep it stored for a year. Cars are quite expensive in Brazil, so yeah, he was going to use the money towards the trip. Now he can use it to explore.\n\nOh, and I'll post an update here once he finds out :)\n\nEdit: UPDATE\n\nSo he got the socks! He has until the 30th to pay for the course so he hasn't found out yet but he did his best to look happy with the socks  It was pretty clear he was disappointed though!\n\nI will need to travel back home tomorrow so I won't be around to actually see his face when he finds out. But I am sure he's gonna call / text so I'll post an update with the reaction :)\n\nEdit: UPDATE\n\nHe found out!! And as promised here's an update on the reaction.\n\nHe called me and he was crying :) He said he called our father to ask if he could borrow a couple grand to be able to make the payment today and my dad told him it had been paid already. He couldn't believe it.\n\nHe kept saying thank you and that he hopes some day he can pay the gesture back. I told him he more than did already. He was there for me everytime I needed. He went out of his way to pull me out of the gutter when I was down. I was always able to rely on him. \n\nHe cried. I cried. \n\nWe talked about the UK, about his plans for the future and decided that, now that he has spare money to explore Europe, we'll take a trip together next summer.\n\nI wish I had been there when he found out. \n\nThank you everyone for your kind words in the comments.

{"prompt": "(Serious) The UK has left the European Union, if you voted Brexit, why? How will it benefit you personally?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.\n\nWhen I voted, it was primarily because of the federalisation of the EU. I am not opposed to this in principle, but I have never been very convinced by how the European government is structured. In particular I was concerned that the European Parliament votes on legislation and cannot *propose* new legislation; they can only debate and amend legislation put forth to them by the European Commission. I believed, and still believe, that there is a fundamental democratic deficit in the European Union and that full integration into a supranational quasi-federation would not be desirable whilst such a deficit exists.\n\n(I feel that the EU *needs* to either fully federalise  or draw back into a looser confederation. The half-and-half state it currently in does not feel robust or stable enough to be properly efficacious)\n\nI was very torn when it came time to vote. I have never considered myself \"european\", and as stated above I had a lot of reservations about the EU; but I also recognised the advantages of membership. At the time I believed that federalisation was inevitable if the EU was to survive and so long as major reforms were not put in place - reforms I had despaired of ever occurring - then I felt the UK would be drawn into what would in essence be a federal oligarchy.\n\nWhen I voted, I made a number of erroneous assumptions about how the Brexit process would unfold which tipped my hand in favour of Leave and which did not come to pass:\n\n1) The Conservative party is self-serving and cruel, but they're not insane\n\n2) Brexit is by nature a political poisoned chalice because of the strong opinions on both sides; Europe has always been a divisive issue and the government must understand this.\n\n3) Because of 2, a bipartisan commission or committee would be established to negotiate Brexit. This would allow the Tories to have their cake and eat it. Setbacks could be blamed on Labour/EU and their own involvement downplayed whilst successes and positive outcomes could be bigged-up since it was still their sitting government \"delivering the will of the electorate\".\n\n4) Even if the Tories did decide to go it alone in the negotiations, they wouldn't be *utterly* incompetent, surely.\n\n5) An election is probably right around the corner because of this mess; maybe we can get a Labour government, or a Labour-led coalition who I believe would negotiate somewhat more competently than a Conservative one.\n\n6) The Leave vote probably won't win anyway, because it seems like everyone is in favour of the EU, or at least willing to look past its flaws.\n\n7) There will be a deal. We will negotiate a deal; it might not please everyone and it might take quite a lot of negotiating, but the PM isn't going to try to ram one particular version of it down Parliament's throats three or four times with little to no amendment or negotiation because that would be stupid.\n\nWhilst I stand by my criticisms of the EU, if there had been a second referendum I would have voted Remain.

About 20 mins in, I thought about politely calling it a day and leaving but in my innocence thought it would be good practice to stay. 40 mins in, its like a light switch goes off inside and hes the nicest guy, his eyes light up and he started hard selling the role and position to me. Introduces me to the team. The director interviews me and he and the team are lovely. Apparently, their interview technique is to be rude to see how you perform under pressure and theyd all been observing using a camera and were impressed I remained so polite and calm throughout. They couldnt understand why I declined.\n\nEDIT: to save me responding to comments. I understand pressure testing is a legitimate technique, and whilst I felt deeply uncomfortable and my gut was screaming at me to get out of there like in a nightclub when you know the creepy guy is really bad news and you need to get out, I understood that it was a possibility that that is what he could have been doing.\n\nHowever to add more context, they had my work history including 10 years in the ambulance services which involves resuscitation whilst the public yell at you and threaten you. Im used to being polite and professional whilst being harassed and threatened. \n\nNothing spreadsheet based, even pulling all nighters is going to match that for pressure and Im well known for staying calm and composed all the time (even if Im exploding inside).\n\nMy biggest objection was not realising I was being broadcast and hearing them discuss my reactions to my face, like I was some kind of movie actor.

{"prompt": "What are some SOLVED mysteries?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In 1981, a Soviet submarine ran aground in Swedish waters. This was a huge deal - although the Soviets claimed the sub was in distress and didnt purposefully enter Swedish waters, basically everyone in Sweden saw it as evidence that their waters were being invaded by spy subs. Plus, they did some snooping of their own and determined that the sub was emitting radiation, meaning it had nukes on board. So they went along with the Soviets clearly false claim about an accident and helped get the sub out of there, but panic was in the air. \n\nSo the Swedes did exactly what youd expect, and they prepared for more Soviet subs. I mean, when you see one Soviet sub, surely there are more, right? So Sweden developed advanced acoustic technology to detect subs and they created a plan to basically seal off their waters when they heard a sub. And wouldnt you know it, a year later, they found a Soviet sub! Well, they didnt *find* it, but they absolutely heard it. And they cut off the bay and figured they just had to hunt the sub down. But after a month, they couldnt find it. They gave up and reopened the bay, but they assumed the sub found a way out. But theyll get it next time! And then it happened again, but they couldnt find it again. And then again and again with no clear pattern for a decade. What the heck!\n\nThankfully, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed. So... no more subs, right? Nyet! Because the Russian subs were still coming! Wait, what?\n\nOkay, so now nothing is making sense. At this point, the Swedish military brought in outside experts to figure out what was happening. This included oceanographer-types who were obvious experts in the surrounding waters. The military then played the audio evidence of the Soviet submarines, only to be told they werent submarines at all - they were *fish*, and the propeller-like sound was water being released from their swim bladders. \n\nAnd thats the story of how the Swedish military spent ten years and tens of millions of dollars chasing fish farts.
